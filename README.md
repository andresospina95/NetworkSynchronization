# Synchronisation of Complex Networks: Kuramoto and Stuart-Landau

This Repository was created as means to share the codes done for my master's degree in Applied Mathematics at UNICAMP.

It contains classes that create Complex Networks of both Kuramoto and Stuart-Landau oscillators, 
as well as functions to both analyze and operate on them, including calculations of the order parameter and other properties.

If this software is to be used for academic publications, or if there are any questions about the code, please e-mail me
at joyce.sclimaco@gmail.com
